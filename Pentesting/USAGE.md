# Pentesting Scripts Usage

### Brute Roots
#### Configuration
Configuration is done within the script itself. In particular `pathWords` tells it where to find your desired wordfile and `pathReports` gives the directory where new reports are to be saved.

#### Usage
If configured, use by invoking the script with the target url as the argument. For example:
`python 3.6 bruteRoots.py www.example.com`

#### Limitations
- Relies on an external wordlist for verification
- Uses the casing native to that wordlist (may be a problem when targeting linux servers, where the URLs are case sensitive.)
- HTTPS only at present.
