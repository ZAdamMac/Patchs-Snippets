# Pentesting Scripts Usage

### Brute Roots
#### Configuration
Configuration is done within the script itself. In particular `pathWords` tells it where to find your desired wordfile and `pathReports` gives the directory where new reports are to be saved.

#### Usage
If configured, use by invoking the script with the target url as the argument. For example:
`python3.6 bruteRoots.py www.example.com`

#### Limitations
- Relies on an external wordlist for verification
- Uses the casing native to that wordlist (may be a problem when targeting linux servers, where the URLs are case sensitive.)
- HTTPS only at present.

### Enumerate
#### Configuration
Configuration is done by modifying the in-line configuration block on line 22. Of particular importance is setting the wordlist path string. The rest are sane defaults for Raspbian with a default uname and gopath.

#### Limitations
This is a relatively dumb enumerator. It will scan TCP, UDP Top-100, and dirbust against port 80 for any hosts that are up.

### PrintF Manip
#### Configuration
Configuration is done within the script itself. The targeted binary's absolute path should be referenced as `tgt_path` and the memory addresses of that binary's version of libc, along with the relevant offsets within libc for various calls, must be provided.

#### Usage
If configured, use by invoking the script. For example:
`python bruteRoots.py`

#### Limitations
- Requires a binary that will take an argument and pass it to a printf call.
- That same binary must not sanitize its inputs.
- The returned shell will be at the same privilege level as the user unless the binary exploited has sticky permissions at a higher level.
- The returned shell will not be any more or less interactive than the parent shell, but does work with the default TCP webshell used by MSF when using Armitage.
